- 👋 Hi, I’m @khalid1500
- 👀 I’m interested in:
  - **Accessibility & Inclusive AI**: I'm passionate about ensuring technology is accessible to everyone and that AI is built inclusively.
  - **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**: The power of language and how machines can understand and generate it fascinates me.
  - **AI in Education**: Exploring how AI can revolutionise the educational landscape and provide personalized learning experiences -- your 24/7 amazing personal tutor, perhaps!
  - **Sports Analytics**: Delving into data-driven insights in sports to uncover patterns and inform coaching decisions. I often ponder questions like, "Which 10m segment is fastest for a 100m runner: the start, middle, or end?" I firmly believe that with the right data and wise interpretation, we can design bespoke training programs in sync with athletes' lifestyles and performance metrics. Just imagine having an AI-powered, highly-experienced personal coach all to yourself!
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - **Python**: Sharpening my skills taking it one step at a time, I want to be a pythonista to have the needed foundation for diving deeper into my areas of interest.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that align with my interests, especially those at the intersection of AI, NLP, and education.

- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to drop me a line at 2elkhk23@solent.ac.uk if you're interested in collaboration, want to chat about these exciting domains, or collaborate on a startup in one of these domains!
